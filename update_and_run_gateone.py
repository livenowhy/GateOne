"""
Checks if Gate One is up-to-date inside the container by performing a
`git pull`.  If new code was pulled it will be automatically installed via
`python setup.py install`

Once that's done it will automatically run the 'gateone' command; passing it any
arguments that were passed to this script.

To disable the automatic update mechanism simply pass --noupdate as a command
line argument to this script.

.. note::

    This script will also update the Tornado framework via the pip command.
